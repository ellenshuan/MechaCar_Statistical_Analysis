## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
I would say that vehicle length and spoiler angle are two variables that provide a non random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. 

The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because the coefficients for the variables are not zero.

I think that this linear model does predict mpg of Mecha Car prototypes effectively because all of the independent variables such as vehicle weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance, and AWD are all good variables to test how it affects the mpg.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
If the design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils should not exceed 100 pounds per square inch, it means that the current manufacturing data does meet this design specification for every lot except the third lot because the variance in numbers for the third lot is too high.
