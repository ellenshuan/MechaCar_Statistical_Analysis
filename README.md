## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
I would say that vehicle length and spoiler angle are two variables that provide a non random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. 

The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because the coefficients for the variables are not zero.

I think that this linear model does predict mpg of Mecha Car prototypes effectively because all of the independent variables such as vehicle weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance, and AWD are all good variables to test how it affects the mpg.
