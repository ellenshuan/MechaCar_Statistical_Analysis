## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
I would say that vehicle length and spoiler angle are two variables that provide a non random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. 

The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because the coefficients for the variables are not zero.

I think that this linear model does predict mpg of Mecha Car prototypes effectively because all of the independent variables such as vehicle weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance, and AWD are all good variables to test how it affects the mpg.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
If the design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils should not exceed 100 pounds per square inch, it means that the current manufacturing data does meet this design specification for every lot except the third lot because the variance in numbers for the third lot is too high.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
With the T tests, when comparing the T test for the PSI across all manufacturing lots to the PSI for each manufacturing lot, it's safe to say that we are accepting the null hypthesis between the PSI across all manufacturing lots and the PSI for lot 1 but we are rejecting the null hypothesis for between the PSI across all manufacturing lots and the PSI for lot 2 and 3. 

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
I would create a test saying the larger the car in size, the lower the gas per milage. After finding the mean car sizes of all car sizes, for the null hypothesis I would expect that the larger the size of the car it would result in lower gas per milage. The alternative hypthesis would say that the larger the size of the car, it would result in higher gas per milage.
